Problem to solve
================

The problem to solve is the synchronization of two fileystem 
directories. Supposing the original structure were:
 
<tree name="root">
<tree name="home">
<tree name="joe">
<file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
</tree>
</tree>
</tree>
 
(which comes down to having one file /home/joe/a.txt). Now, if the 
modified structure were something like:
 
<tree name="root">
<tree name="home">
<tree name="joe">
<file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
<file name="b.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="1234"/>
</tree>
</tree>
</tree>
 
the diff between the two would be the new file /home/joe/b.txt.

The action to be take is to create the /home/joe/b.txt using a 
possibly mock implementation of the following Java interface :
https://github.com/dtrott/fuse4j/blob/master/maven/fuse4j-core/src/main/java/fuse/Filesystem3.java.
 
The goal of the exercise is to write a program in the Java language that 
is able to detect diffs between such XML descriptions for a number of 
common cases:
* file update
* new file
* new directory
* file rename
* ...
 
The provided tests will be automatically reproductible, prove the 
correct working of the code and will be illustrative of the usage of the 
software. The provided package should respect the standard Java layout 
and have a command-line automatic build which can build the sources and 
run tests.
