Introduction
============
This code is an implementation to solve the problem detailed below.

How to use
==========
from the project root folder
cd to "bin" folder
launch "./exercice.sh"
(comming soon for windows OS : "./exercice.bat")

How to build
============
This project uses a simple ant build.
Prerequisite : have ant installed and accessible from command promt (ie. ant binary se in the path).
from the project root folder launch "ant"

Problem to solve
================

The problem to solve is the synchronization of two fileystem 
directories. Supposing the original structure were:
 
<tree name="root">
<tree name="home">
<tree name="joe">
<file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
</tree>
</tree>
</tree>
 
(which comes down to having one file /home/joe/a.txt). Now, if the 
modified structure were something like:
 
<tree name="root">
<tree name="home">
<tree name="joe">
<file name="a.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="5032"/>
<file name="b.txt" modif-date="20120102T1030" size="1234"/>
</tree>
</tree>
</tree>
 
the diff between the two would be the new file /home/joe/b.txt.

The action to be take is to create the /home/joe/b.txt using a 
possibly mock implementation of the following Java interface :
https://github.com/dtrott/fuse4j/blob/master/maven/fuse4j-core/src/main/java/fuse/Filesystem3.java.
 
The goal of the exercise is to write a program in the Java language that 
is able to detect diffs between such XML descriptions for a number of 
common cases:
* file update
* new file
* new directory
* file rename
* ...
 
The provided tests will be automatically reproductible, prove the 
correct working of the code and will be illustrative of the usage of the 
software. The provided package should respect the standard Java layout 
and have a command-line automatic build which can build the sources and 
run tests.


Technical Specifications
========================
  
  Program inputs :
  ----------------
  2 distinct xml files representing a filesystem structure with tree tags (for directories) and file tags (for files). 
  
  Program output :
  ----------------
  A data structure identifying differences between the two filesystem structures provided as xml entry point files.
  
  Development process :
  ---------------------
  First we'll be writing this document and also add some commentary in empty code structures as //TODO items. 
  Then for each point we'll write the appropriate unit test for Junit.
  And after we'll implement the method that satisfies the preceding tests to have them all executed with success.
  At this point some code refactoring could be done on existing code and test should still execute with success. 
  The global development process will be iterative.
  Even once the final goal is achieved, we'll have to review the work we've done to determine if there are some way to improve it or add missing functionnalities.
  
  Problematic
  -----------
  At first sight the problematic is quite simple. 
  We need to detect added or deleted tags, and those for which the attributes are different.
  * Possible Solution :
      - load files as Dom Documents to manipulate them easily.
      - list all elements that should be tested.
      - for each element :
          _ test if present in the other document, if missing then file/tree is only present on the analyzed document (ie added) => took action to save this difference for the final report. 
          _ test if present but with different attributes (ie modified),  => took action to save this difference for the final report. 
          _ if present delete the Element from the other document if also present whether or not it has different attributes.
          _ list all remaining elements in the other document. Due to the receeding step that means thos files aren't present in the first document (ie deleted from it) => took action to save this difference for the final report. 
      - parse the result object to summarize all the detected changes.
  This solution raises one question : how to identify elements selected on one document to search for it on another.
  We propose to store each references in a map. The key would be a concatenation of the Element absolute path constructed using a path separator, ancestors @name attribute, and the element name, and the value the Element object it self.
  eg: <root><tree name="home"><tree name="joe"><file name="a.txt" date... /></tree></tree></root> would add the entry : ["/home/joe/a.txt",Element] 
  Then we'll have to iterate over that map for the core treatment (ie differences detection).	
  
Todo
====
// TODO check program usage
// TODO load input files from parameters
// TODO process to detect differences (additions, modifications, deletions)
// TODO render results
Add a logger system.
Refactor the ant build
(Duplicate the project for a maven build)
Generate javadoc
